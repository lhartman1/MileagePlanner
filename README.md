# MileagePlanner

This app allows the user to plan their weekly mileage. Although the real purpose of this is just to get more experience with Jetpack Compose.

The word "mileage" isn't used in the app, so you can really use it to plan anything you want! Instead of miles ran/biked/walked, you could use it for pages read in a book, beers drank, or whatever!
